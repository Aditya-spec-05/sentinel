PROJECT-SENTINEL is a lightweight, single-file web dashboard designed for real-time monitoring of IoT devices. This version is specifically configured as a warning and alarming system that tracks the connectivity status of critical hardware, triggers alerts for offline events, and maintains a count of these incidents.

The interface features a modern, high-contrast dark theme, ensuring excellent readability and a focus on critical status indicators. As it is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it requires no complex setup and can be run directly in any modern web browser.
